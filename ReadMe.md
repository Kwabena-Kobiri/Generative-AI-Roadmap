## 1. Prompt Engineering

Learn how to effectively communicate with existing AI models such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. This step covers:
- Understanding the basics of prompt construction
- Techniques for clear and concise prompts
- Strategies for handling model limitations

## 2. Basic Q&A with LLM APIs

Explore how to integrate Large Language Models into your applications using APIs. This section includes:
- Setting up API access for models like GPT-4 and Claude
- Implementing basic question-answering functionality
- Handling API responses and error cases

## 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Discover how to enhance AI responses with external knowledge. Topics covered:
- Building a document index
- Implementing vector search
- Integrating retrieved information with LLM responses

## 4. Agentic Systems

Learn about AI systems that can take actions and make decisions. This step explores:
- Fundamentals of agentic AI
- Implementing goal-oriented behaviors
- Ethical considerations in autonomous systems

## 5. Fine-tuning LLMs

Adapt existing language models to your specific use case. This section covers:
- Preparing training data
- Techniques for efficient fine-tuning
- Evaluating fine-tuned model performance

## 6. Building Your Own LLM

For advanced users, explore the process of creating a language model from scratch:
- Understanding model architectures
- Data preparation and tokenization
- Training and optimization techniques

## Getting Started

Each step in this roadmap has its own directory with detailed instructions, code samples, and resources. Begin with Step 1 and progress through each stage to build a comprehensive understanding of Generative AI technologies.
