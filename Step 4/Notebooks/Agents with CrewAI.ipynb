    "# Step 4 - Agents and Agentic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of agentic systems using CrewAI, a framework for creating multi-agent AI systems. It covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up the development environment by installing necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Creating a news publishing agentic system with three agents:\n",
    "   - Planner Agent: Plans the content of the article\n",
    "   - Writer Agent: Writes the content based on the planner's outline\n",
    "   - Editor Agent: Edits the blog post to align with the organization's style\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building a customer support agentic system with two agents:\n",
    "   - Support Agent: Provides answers to user queries\n",
    "   - Support Quality Assurance Agent: Verifies the accuracy of the support agent's responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to:\n",
    "- Define agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories\n",
    "- Create tasks for each agent\n",
    "- Set up a crew of agents to work together\n",
    "- Use tools like web scraping to enhance agent capabilities\n",
    "- Execute the agentic system and review the output\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical implementation showcases the power of multi-agent systems in automating complex tasks such as content creation and customer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: This notebook is based on the course from DeepLearning.AI called [Multi AI Agent Systems With CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/)"

      "Final Answer: LangGraph is a versatile tool that can be integrated with LangChain for enhanced functionality or used independently based on the specific needs of your project. When integrated with LangChain, LangGraph leverages its graph-based data structures to provide context and relational information, which significantly enhances language models' understanding and generation capabilities. This integration facilitates a deeper semantic understanding of text and improves the accuracy and relevance of generated content.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you choose to use LangGraph independently, it functions as a powerful standalone tool capable of constructing and managing complex graph-based data representations. This capability allows users to organize and query large datasets in ways that traditional databases cannot, making it particularly useful for applications involving complex relationships and networked data. Independent usage includes the ability to create custom graphs, analyze relationships, and derive insights from interconnected data without the need for language model integration.\n",

      "This flexibility in deployment makes LangGraph suitable for a wide range of applications, from enhancing AI language capabilities when used with LangChain to serving as a robust data analysis and management tool in its own right.

      "LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the development, productionization, and deployment stages of LLM application lifecycle. Here’s how you can leverage LangChain for your backend development with FastAPI:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Development**: \n",
      "   - You can build your applications using LangChain’s open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations. \n",
      "   - Use LangGraph to build robust and stateful multi-actor applications. LangGraph models steps as edges and nodes in a graph, which integrates smoothly with LangChain but can also be used independently. When integrated with LangChain, LangGraph leverages its graph-based data structures to provide context and relational information, enhancing the language models' understanding and generation capabilities. Independently, LangGraph functions as a powerful tool capable of constructing and managing complex graph-based data representations, useful for applications involving complex relationships and networked data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Productionization**: \n",
      "   - LangSmith, a developer platform within LangChain, allows you to inspect, monitor, evaluate, and optimize your LLM applications continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deployment**: \n",
      "   - Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and assistants with LangGraph Cloud.\n",
      "   - LangServe can be used to deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs, which you can integrate seamlessly with your FastAPI backend.\n",
      "\n",
      "For specific steps and more detailed instructions, you might want to explore the following resources on the LangChain documentation:\n",
      "- Tutorials on building simple LLM applications, chatbots, agents, and more.\n",
      "- How-to guides for quick solutions to common tasks such as adding memory to chatbots, using vector stores as retrievers, etc.\n",
      "- API reference for full documentation of all classes and methods in the LangChain Python packages.\n",
