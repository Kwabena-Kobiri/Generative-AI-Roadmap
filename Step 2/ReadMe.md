## Step 2: Basic Q&A with LLM APIs

In this step, you'll learn how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) through their APIs, enabling you to create basic question-answering systems.

### LLM Providers

#### Closed Source Providers:
1. [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) - Offers models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
2. [Anthropic's Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/welcome) - Provides the Claude model series.
3. [Google's Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) - Google's latest LLM offering.

#### Open Source Models:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - A platform hosting numerous open-source models that can be used locally or through their API.

### Integration Tools

To simplify working with various LLM providers, you can use orchestration tools such as:

1. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) - A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
2. [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) - A data framework for building LLM applications.

These tools provide abstractions that make it easier to switch between different LLM providers and build complex applications.

### Getting Started
