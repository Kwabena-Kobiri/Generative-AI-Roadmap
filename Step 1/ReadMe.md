# Step 1: Prompt Engineering

In this step, you'll learn how to effectively communicate with existing AI models through prompt engineering. We'll start by accessing popular LLM platforms and then move on to resources for improving your prompt engineering skills.

## Accessing LLM Platforms

To begin interacting with Large Language Models, you can use one of the following platforms:

1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - OpenAI's chatbot interface for GPT models
2. [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/) - Anthropic's AI assistant
3. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - Google's conversational AI

Choose one of these platforms to start practicing your prompt engineering skills. Each platform may require you to create an account if you haven't already.

## Prompt Engineering Resources

To enhance your prompt engineering skills, we recommend the following resources:

1. [Prompt Engineering Tutorial â€“ Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvnD73m40o)
   - This YouTube tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering techniques.

2. [Prompt engineering - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)
   - OpenAI's official guide to prompt engineering, offering insights directly from the creators of GPT models.

## Practice Exercises

After reviewing the resources, try the following exercises to improve your prompt engineering skills:

1. Write a prompt to generate a short story about a time traveler.
2. Create a prompt to explain a complex scientific concept to a 5-year-old.
3. Develop a prompt to generate a list of pros and cons for a controversial topic.
4. Design a prompt to create a step-by-step guide for a task of your choice.
5. Craft a prompt to analyze a piece of text for sentiment and key themes.

Remember to experiment with different phrasings and structures in your prompts. Pay attention to how small changes in your prompts can lead to significant differences in the AI's responses.

## Next Steps

Once you feel comfortable with basic prompt engineering, move on to Step 2 to learn about using LLM APIs into your own piece of code.
